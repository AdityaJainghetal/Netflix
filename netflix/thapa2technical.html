           The Centre has asked all departments to deploy officers to showcase its achievements across the country down
            to the village level, through a roadshow titled Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra, which will run from November 20
            to January 25, 2024. To be sure, the outreach is only about achievements of the last nine years that
            corresponds to the two terms of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that began in 2014. The campaign is
            conveniently timed for the Lok Sabha election which is expected in April-May 2024. Joint Secretaries,
            Directors, and Deputy Secretaries will be appointed Rath Prabharis (chariots in-charge) for the roadshow.
            Separately, the Ministry of Defence is setting up 822 selfie points where citizens can click themselves
            with a picture of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Guidelines issued by the Ministry go into great details on
            how to promote the work of the last nine years. It has been directed that these selfie points “should be set
            up at prominent locations, which have maximum footfall and the potential of attracting public attention”.
            War memorials, defence museums, railway and metro stations, bus stations, airports, malls and market places,
            schools and colleges, tourist destinations and festival gatherings are places where these points are coming
            up. Opposition parties led by Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge have called out the government for this
            brazen politicisation of the bureaucracy and the military.</p>
